// The starter code is a naive recursive solution for the computing the 
// nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

// Runtime complexity: O(2^n)
// Space complexity: O(n)

// This is a very commonly used example of repeated computations that can
//  (and should!) be optimized with memoization, and the runtime problem 
// is best illustrated by a tree diagram of fibonacci() calls. Google 
// "recursive fibonacci diagram" in case you haven't seen that visual before.

// The total number of calls to the fibonacci function grows exponentially 
// as n increases, causing a major runtime issue that will grind things to 
// a halt, even before n gets that large.

// The easy fix here is to "remember the answer" to problems we've already
//  solved, and this is called memoization. By simply keeping a map of all 
// the fibonacci values we've already calculated, then we'll avoid having 
// to repeat that work again later on.

// Specifically, the natural way to use a map (hash map) data structure here 
// is as a kind of lookup table. After finding a solution for a given n, 
// store a key/value pair where the key is n and the value is fibonacci(n). 
// Then when you need that solution to build up to a higher level in the 
// sequence, look it up in the map (a constant time operation!) rather 
// than repeating all the work again.

// Optimize this naive solution to implement this memoization approach, 
// for a Fibonacci implementaiton with linear O(n) (rather than exponential) runtime.

// Test cases:
console.log(fibonacci(0)) // 0
console.log(fibonacci(1)) // 1
console.log(fibonacci(2)) // 1
console.log(fibonacci(8)) // 21
console.log(fibonacci(17)) // 1597
console.log(fibonacci(58)) // 591286729879

// Note: the final test case is commented out since it will blow up on even 
// a very fast computer. With the memoized solution though, this test case 
// will also run easily.
